# image-labelling-app

### Description:

This is a simple image labeling app that allows users to upload an image and receive a list of labels that describe the contents of the image. The app uses Firebase for the client-side and Google Cloud Functions for the server-side. The Google Cloud Functions use the Google Cloud Vision API to process the images and extract the labels.

#### Files:

- index.html - The HTML file for the client-side of the app.
- app.js - The JavaScript file for the client-side of the app.
- package.json - The npm package file that lists the required dependencies for the app.
- index.js - The main JavaScript file for the server-side of the app that contains the Google Cloud Function.
To run the app, you will need to set up a Firebase project and a Google Cloud project, and configure the required services. You will also need to install the required dependencies using npm.
